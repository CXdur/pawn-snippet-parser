# pawn-snippet-parser
Simple bash script to parse Pawn files for functions. The functions can be converted into JSON and imported as snippets into a code editor. 

## Note:
This is currently a work in progress, and the reasoning behind this project is purely for educational reasons. It is uploaded here in case it might be useful to others. Non-recursive searches will be replaced with file searches. Non-recursive searches are currently not functional.
